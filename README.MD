# Hash_Tables

#### By Vanshika Sinha

## Task-1: Getting started

This task involved writing a hash table to store the frequency of names in an unordered list of Irish surnames where 'char' arrays are used as keys and values are stored as 'int'. The linear probing strategy is used to handle collisions.

## Task-2: Choosing a hash function

This task involved the choice of a hash function for the given data and testing the hash function on the sample data.

## Task-3: Twice the fun

This task involved the use of a hashing function 'hash3' and augment the solution to Task-1 such that it uses double hashing instead of linear probing.

## Task-4: A more interesting application

This task involved the expansion of solution to the previous tasks where instead of storing term counts at each index, a list of people should be stored with a given surname. The keys of the hash tables are surnames and the values are the linked lists of people.
